        Despite the numerous interventions to curb the endangers of HIV/AIDS, Ghana and the world at large
        should have taken the following necessary steps when HIV/AIDS was detected;
        Awareness. Ghana and the world at large should have intensified the awareness of the disease by educating
        the society through the media available by then such as radio, newspapers and television. The World Health
        Organisation (W.H.O) should have thrown more light on the causes, symptoms and effects on the
        overwhelming disease. There should have been the need for sensitization. Thus, HIV/AIDS should have
        been a subject of study in the basic schools to enlighten kids whiles they grow. The World Health
        Organisation could have organised seminars in local dialects of nations to create awareness to the illiterates.
        However, taking keen interest on mass screening should have been a measure the world Health Organisation
        (W.H.O) could have considered, after the case was identified to help detect infected persons from uninfected
        ones to enable them educate the infected on how to control the virus whiles the uninfected would be
        educated on how not to contract the virus due to lack of medication to subdue the virus.
        HIV/AIDS research includes all medical research that attempts to prevent, treat or cure HIV/AIDS as well as
        fundamental research about the nature of HIV as an infectious agent and AIDS as the disease caused by
        HIV. To this regard, individuals should have been encouraged to take career in HIV/AIDS due to the
        insufficient researchers of HIV/AIDS as at that time. World Health Organization (W.H.O) could have also
        funded the research towards HIV in order to have invented drugs in due time when the disease was detected.
        Again, most countries were economically unstable which necessitated “the operation feed yourself”. Due to
        that, individuals found themselves engaging in immoral works such as prostitution which to an extent spread
        the virus abroad. The W.H.O in collaboration with the World Bank could have come out with financial
        policies to help improve the economic stability of poverty stricken countries. They could have supported
        countries by establishing vocational institutions to help reduce immoral works like prostitution.
        In conclusion, the National Institute of Health (NIH) representing the largest public investment of
HIV/AIDS research in the world is engaging in research around the globe to understand, diagnose, treat and
prevent HIV/AIDS infection and its many associated conditions and to find cure, and also to encourage free
screening and testing for HIV/AIDS in both private and government health agencies including pharmacies to
provide preventive services , save lives and improve health conditions of carriers, since the stigma as to
people being kicked out of their jobs, harassed and assaulted by community who found out their status and
sometimes killed was a wide spread.
